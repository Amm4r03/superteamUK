## Description

AI-Powered Context-Aware Blockchain Explorer is a cutting-edge Chrome extension designed to enhance your browsing experience on blockchain-related websites. With this extension, you can effortlessly summarize the content of any page with a single click or set it to automatically summarize specific types of websites. From the generated summaries, you can then ask questions using our integrated Language Learning Model (LLM).

### Key Features
- **One-Click Summarization**: Instantly generate concise summaries of any webpage.
- **Automatic Summarization**: Configure settings to auto-summarize specific types of websites.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Ask questions directly from the generated summaries using our advanced LLM.
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrate with Firebase to reference and query texts directly within your code.

## Further Development

### Firebase Integration
In future iterations, we aim to integrate Firebase to enable direct text references within our code. This integration will allow for a more streamlined and efficient querying process, making it easier to extract and utilize information.

## Potential and Loopholes

### Potential
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Simplifies the process of understanding complex blockchain-related content.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Saves time by providing quick summaries and answers to user queries.
- **Scalability**: Can be adapted to various types of content beyond blockchain.

### Loopholes
- **Accuracy of Summaries**: The quality of summaries depends on the accuracy and capability of the LLM.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Handling and processing of sensitive information need strict security measures.
- **Dependency on Internet Connection**: Requires a stable internet connection for real-time summarization and querying.
